Generate a title for the podcast episode based on the research presented in the script.
The title should clearly describe the primary research finding, and you can use '|' to combine related statements.
Avoid using colons in the title.
Only include acronyms if they are widely recognized (e.g., AI, RNA, DNA).

Example:
Enhancing Metabolite Identification with Machine Learning | Advancements in Spatial Metabolomics Analysis

Script: {script}
